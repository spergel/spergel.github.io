                <p>I'm Joshua Spergel. I graduated from Princeton University in 2023 with a B.A. in History and a minor (they used the word "certificate" because they like the sound of it more, idk) in Computer Science. I am currently working mainly on web development stuff. I made <a href="https://www.tech.somethingtodo.nyc" target="_blank">tech.somethingtodo.nyc</a> to help people find things to do in New York City. I am currently trying to bootstrap a startup that fills out PDFs with AI. Right now I am hosting it at <a href="https://www.fillpdfs.com" target="_blank">fillpdfs.com</a>. I'm also working on a few other projects, which I'll post about here as they come together. </p>
                <p>I used to work in the Cairo Geniza lab, where I made <a href= "/geniza_graph/graoh.html">a graph visualization of the Cairo Geniza</a>. I also made a <a href= "/translation_game/translation_game.html">translation game</a> which shows LLMs capability to translate from even lesser known languages, like Judeo-Arabic, into English. It's still a work in progress, but I have not kept up with it.</p>
                <p>I'm also interested in the intersection of technology and the humanities, and I'm always looking for new ways to use technology to make the humanities more accessible and engaging.</p>
